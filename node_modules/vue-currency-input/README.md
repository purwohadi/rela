# Vue Currency Input

[![](docs/vue-currency-input.gif)](https://dm4t2.github.io/vue-currency-input)

Vue Currency Input allows an easy input of currency formatted numbers based on the [ECMAScript Internationalization API (Intl.NumberFormat)](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Intl/NumberFormat), supporting both Vue 2 and Vue 3.

Built on top of the [Vue Composition API](https://v3.vuejs.org/guide/composition-api-introduction.html), it enables you to decorate _any_ input component with currency format capabilities.
